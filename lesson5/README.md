### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned that the if statement only returns value when the statement is true)
2. (The if/else statement is used when the statement is false and we want something else to happen instead of the directions intended with the if statement)
3. (the nested if is used when one decision making contains another decision making)
